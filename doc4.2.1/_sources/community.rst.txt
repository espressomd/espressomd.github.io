Community support
-----------------

If you have any questions concerning |es| which you cannot resolve by
yourself, you may search for an answer on:

- `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/espressomd/espresso/issues?q=>`__
- `GitHub discussions <https://github.com/espressomd/espresso/discussions>`__
- `espressomd-users mailing list archive <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/espressomd-users/>`__
- `Installation FAQ <https://github.com/espressomd/espresso/wiki/Installation-FAQ>`__

If you still didn't find a solution, you may consider either opening a new
issue or discussion on GitHub, or sending an email on the mailing list.
Instructions on how to register to the mailing lists and post messages can be
found in `Mailing Lists
<https://espressomd.org/wordpress/community-and-support/mailing-lists/>`__.
It is recommended to use these communication channels rather than to contact
individual developers, for several reasons:

-  All users get your message and you have a higher
   probability that it is answered soon.
-  Your question and the answers are archived and the archives can be
   searched by others.
-  The answer may be useful also to other users.
-  There may not be a unique answer to your problem and it may be useful
   to get suggestions from different people.

Please remember that this is a community mailing list and a community GitHub
forum. It is other users and developers who are answering your questions.
They do it in their free time and are not paid for doing it.
